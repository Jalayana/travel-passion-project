            <h2>Why Okinawa?</h2>
            <h3>Okinawa is known as one of the "islands of longevity."</h3>
            <p>
              Okinawa Prefecture is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan. It
              comprises more than 160 inhabited and uninhabited islands, with a
              combined area of over 2,000 square kilometers. The population is
              around 1.4 million. The prefectural capital, Naha, is located on
              Okinawa’s main island. It’s also the economic and cultural
              capital, and the most populous area of the islands. Naha’s Shuri
              area was the capital of the Ryukyu Kingdom, an independent country
              that flourished as a trading hub before becoming part of Japan in
              1879.
            </p>
            <p>
              The islands of Okinawa are one of the world’s “Blue Zones,” areas
              where a population has a life expectancy much higher than the
              global average. There are many factors that are thought to support
              the longevity of Okinawans; especially the subtropical marine
              climate of the islands, which is warm and stable year round; its
              diverse environment, from beautiful seasides to lush forests,
              stony karsts, and other natural features; the healthy eating
              habits and mindset born from island culture.

                <p>
                  Gyokusendo is a five-kilometer-long limestone cave formed
                  hundreds of thousands of years ago. The stalactites and
                  stalagmites in the cave grow 1 millimeter every three years –
                  considerably faster than those found in other prefectures. The
                  secret to their speed is said to be Okinawa’s subtropical
                  climate.
